= PochetteWeb

This project aims to be a developer sandbox for
building transactions using [Pochette](https://github.com/bitex-la/pochette)
and signing them using [Trezor devices](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/)

It also features a P2SH multisig address generator for Trezor and let's you
spend from these type of addresses.

Check out the demo at [pochette_sandbox.bitex.la](https://pochette_sandbox.bitex.la)

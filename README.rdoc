= PochetteWeb

This project aims to be a developer sandbox for
building transactions using [https://github.com/bitex-la/pochette](Pochette)
and signing them using [https://www.bitcointrezor.com/](Trezor devices)

It also features a P2SH multisig address generator for Trezor and let's you
spend from these type of addresses.
